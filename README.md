# number-guessing-game

This is my very first HTML/CSS/JavaScript project.
HTML & CSS by myself, the JavaScript part with a lot of supervision.

The rules:
Try and guess the number between 0 and 100, by typing a number of your choice and follow instructions. There is a guess count, and several instructions, whenever the number is too high or too low, or below 0, or above 100, also when you already typed that guess.
The coding part was mainly focused on if/else conditions, for this first project.
